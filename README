This Systemmenu applet allows to switch between local and remote sound output.
It allows sending sound to one of multiple configured esound or pulseaudio servers.
It requires the esound macports package and Soundflower to be installed.
It uses esound so sending audio to pulseaudio only works if the pulseaudioserver has the esdcompat module loaded.
